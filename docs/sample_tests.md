### Sample Tests

Testing is available through the React testing library and React Testing utilities. A couple of samples tests can be found:

- Test for the `navbar` component which uses react-dom test-utils for checking if there is a Login button in navbar.

  
*Jest* comes preconfigured as the test-runner for your and is included in the gitpod.yml for running tests in watch mode in a terminal when the Devspaces is opened.

You can also run it manually using the command:
```
npm run test
```
