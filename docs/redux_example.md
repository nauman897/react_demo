### Using Redux for State Management

You can find a sample component `Counter` in the `home` page which demonstrates the use of Redux for state management in your application.

Similar to it every component requiring state management should have a container file, a component file and a reducer file in its `components` subfolder.

Redux store is configured in the `src/redux/configure-store.tsx` file. Modify it to add the reducers corresponding to your other components.
