# Linting

A custom linting configuration file [.eslintrc.json](../.eslintrc.json) has been provided along with a [.eslintignore](../.eslintignore) file.

You can add your own linting rules in the `.eslintrc.json` file. For more information on how to configure ESLint, refer to the [ESLint documentation](https://eslint.org/docs/user-guide/configuring).
